Because the libft project involves many functions to test, I decided to make testing as simple as possible by creating a completely separate directory, testlibft, to hold all the test files. This directory contains its own Makefile, which utilizes the libft.a library created by the libft Makefile.

In order to use this setup, youâ€™ll need to update the LIBFT_DIR variable in testlibft/Makefile to point to the location where your libft repository is cloned.

How It Works
Build the Library: Go to the libft directory and run make. This will create the libft.a library if libft is built correctly.
Build the Tests: Go to the testlibft directory and run make. This will compile each test file into a separate executable. You can then run each test executable independently, like so:

```
./test_ft_strlen
./test_ft_memcpy
```

etc.
